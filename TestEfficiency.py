Description: Contains functions and plots for testing the efficiency of the solve function
             from the SemanticNetsAgent.py script.

Problem: You are a shepherd tasked with getting sheep and wolves across a river for some reason. 
         If the wolves ever outnumber the sheep on either side of the river, the wolves will overpower
         and eat the sheep. You have a boat, which can only take one or two animals in it at a time,
         and must have at least one animal in it because youâ€™ll get lonely (and because the problem
         is trivial otherwise). How do you move all the animals from one side of the river to the other?

Notes: Generates and saves four plots comparing three sets of tests. 
       First set calculates the time when there is one less wolf than sheep.
       Second set calculates the time when there is 50% the amount of wolves than sheep.
       Third set calculates the time when there is 75% the amount of wolves than sheep.

       Each plot will plot the results for their respective set, the last plot is all three of the
       sets overlayed on top of each other.
