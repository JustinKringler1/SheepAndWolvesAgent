Description: Script that tests SemanticNetsAgent.py for mini project 1 in CS7637.

Problem: You are a shepherd tasked with getting sheep and wolves across a river for some reason. 
         If the wolves ever outnumber the sheep on either side of the river, the wolves will overpower
         and eat the sheep. You have a boat, which can only take one or two animals in it at a time,
         and must have at least one animal in it because youâ€™ll get lonely (and because the problem
         is trivial otherwise). How do you move all the animals from one side of the river to the other?

Notes: The test functions uses the solve function from SemanticNetsAgent.py
